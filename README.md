# hisham-gl

Made my own graphics library coz I can't get graphics.h to work properly on my system.

Tested on Arch Linux (6.7.3), but should work on any Linux machine.

## Dependancies

libc and SDL2(optional; for rendering directly into a window)

## Documentation

- If SDL isin't your cup of tea, then you can output your artwork as a ppm file.
